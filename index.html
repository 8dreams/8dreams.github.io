<h2>What is 8values?</h2>
    <p>8dreams, based on 8values, is a political quiz that attempts to assign percentages for eight different off-compass political values. You will be presented by a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be compared to the maximum possible for each value, thus giving you a percentage. Answer honestly!<br /><br />
    There are <b><u><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></u></b> questions in the test.</p>

<h2>What are the eight values?</h2>
    <p>There are four independent axes - Propietary, Mastery, Individuality, and Prioritative - and each has two opposing values assigned to them. They are:</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#d32f2f;">Altruity</b> (Propietary)<br/>
        Those with higher Altruity scores believe that all property, no matter the form or ownership, should be collectivized. This can include information, all forms of money, etc.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#00796b;">Avarice</b> (Propietary)<br/>
        Those with higher Avarice scores believe that all forms of property should be privatized and competed in the market. Those who are dominant within the market economy should thus gain more property.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#f57c00;">Dominant</b> (Mastery)<br/>
        Those with a higher Dominant score tend to want their ideology spread throughout the world. They think force can be used when spreading an ideology.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#0288d1;">Insular</b> (Mastery)<br/>
        Those with a higher Insular score tend to avoid forcing an opinion. They would use methods like convincement, propaganda, etc.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#fbc02d;">Self</b> (Individuality)<br/>
        Those with higher Self scores believe in the power of the individual. They tend to support an anarchist or egoist government. They believe Egoism is what makes humans humans, and it is impossible to avoid such thing.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#303f9f;">Totality</b> (Individuality)<br/>
        Those with higher Authority scores believe in an absolute government. They think individuals have no power at all, and only the state should have power.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#689f38;">Stalwart</b> (Prioritative)<br/>
        Those with higher Tradition scores believe that a person is what he is, and his/her characteristics can only by dictated by the strong or by the surrounding environment.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#7b1fa2;">Hedonic</b> (Prioritative)<br/>
        Those with higher Progress scores believe that a person's personal happiness is the core value of any human. Though not always, they are usually secular or atheist, and support different types of communities standing up for their own characteristics.</p>
<h2>What's the "Closest Match" mean at the bottom of the results?</h2>
    <p>In addition to matching you to the eight values, the quiz also attempts to match you to a political ideology. This is a work in progress and is much less accurate than the values and axes, so don't take it too seriously. If you disagree with your assigned ideology, send us an email at 8dreams.info@gmail.com with your scores, matched ideology, and preferred ideology, and we'll look into adjusting the system. Thanks!</p>
<h2>I don't like my scores!</h2>
